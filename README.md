These are the folders.
The search folder and the addition folder are the item search and item addition use cases completed. 
The shared folder houses the inventory data and the tabs style. 
The inventory-data.js stores the data the helper functions associated with it. 
The tabs.css houses the tab style that is shared between the addition and search pages. 
Because of this, the two files are both stored in shared since both search and addition require them to work. 
The inventory-data.js file is not an acutal database. 
For example, when items are added, the file is not appended to account for the new data.
This new data is stored elsewhere. 
If anyone wants to make a proper database, you are more than welcome to.
